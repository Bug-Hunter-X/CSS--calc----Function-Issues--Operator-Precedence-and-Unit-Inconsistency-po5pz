The CSS `calc()` function can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency. For example, the following code might not render as expected if the browser interprets the calculation differently than intended:  `width: calc(50% - 10px);` This may work in some browsers, but not in others.  Another issue arises when combining different units without proper conversion.  `width: calc(100px + 50%);` might not always give the result you want.
